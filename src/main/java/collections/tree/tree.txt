- Tree
    - A Collection of entities - "Nodes" connected by "Edges"
    - Each Node can contain value and it may or may not have a child node
    - Leaf nodes
        Nodes without childres

Terminology summary
    Root is the topmost node of the tree
    Edge is the link between two nodes
    Child is a node that has a parent node
    Parent is a node that has an edge to a child node
    Leaf is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
    Height is the length of the longest path to a leaf
    Depth is the length of the path to its root

- Height of tree
    - Empty tree = -1
    - Single node = 0

- Depth of a Tree
    length of the path to the root


- Differernt Types of Tree
    - Binary Tree
    - Sorted Binary Tree
    - AVL
        - Always rotate for an insertion
    - red black tree
        - max rotations is 2


Tree Traversal :
    DFS:
        is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure.
        One starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

    BFS:
